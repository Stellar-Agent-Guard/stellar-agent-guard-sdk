/**
 * Shared vendoring helper: one refresh entry point for every vendored
 * cross-repo artifact this SDK keeps (issue #133).
 *
 * The SDK vendors cross-repo artifacts as committed, hash-pinned files so the
 * test suite is hermetic — no test that decides pass/fail may fetch from the
 * network at run time. Vendoring (committing a copy + provenance) is how the
 * SDK has handled the contracts repo's reason vocabulary since Phase 2
 * (`tests/fixtures/contract-fixtures.json`, refreshed by `npm run sync:fixtures`);
 * the PolicyConfig JSON schema (`tests/fixtures/vendor/policy.schema.json`) is
 * the same pattern with one more guard: the file's own SHA-256 digest is
 * recorded next to it, so a refresh that changes even a byte must update the
 * digest in the same commit — an accidental hand-edit or a truncated download
 * fails the integrity test instead of silently becoming the new truth.
 *
 * One helper, several feeds (issue #133's "sequence note"): the reason
 * vocabulary feed (`npm run sync:fixtures`) landed first and keeps its own
 * script; this module does not absorb it. It exists so the *next* vendored feed
 * does not have to reinvent the provenance shape — and so each vendor entry
 * below is one object with one `refresh` implementation, rather than a third
 * copy of the same write-and-stamp logic.
 *
 * Provenance contract (enforced by `tests/unit/policy-schema.test.ts`):
 * every vendored artifact carries a `_provenance` header with the source repo,
 * the pinned source commit, the source path, the pinned content digest, the
 * refresh command, and an explicit `upstreamLanded: false` acknowledgement
 * when vendored ahead of the upstream file's own issue landing.
 *
 * ## Refresh protocol (what happens when contracts #61 lands)
 *
 * 1. `git fetch upstream && git rev-parse upstream/main` → note the SHA.
 * 2. Update `POLICY_SCHEMA.repoCommit` below to that SHA and flip its
 *    `upstreamLanded` to `true` — in the same commit as step 4.
 * 3. `npm run vendor:refresh` → re-fetches, re-hashes, rewrites the vendored
 *    file + `digest` + `updatedAt` in one write.
 * 4. Commit the artifact and its digest together. The SDK validator's
 *    expectations re-derive from the refreshed file, so drift fails the
 *    policy-schema test rather than waiting for review to catch it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run vendor:refresh          # refresh every registered feed
 *   npm run vendor:refresh -- --dry-run
