/**
 * Live enforcement integration tests — the actual Phase 2 exit criterion.
 *
 * Every test below drives the real `invoke()` pipeline against the live Phase 2
 * instance on testnet and asserts on what the network did. Nothing is mocked:
 * an allowed action carries a real transaction hash that is re-read from the RPC,
 * and a blocked action is a real refusal by the deployed `__check_auth` that
 * never reached the mempool.
 *
 * On evidence standards, because "blocked" is easy to fake and easy to
 * misreport: a block happens in enforced re-simulation, *before* broadcast, so
 * by construction it has no transaction hash. The evidence for a block is
 * therefore the contract's own `event_auth_checked, blocked, <reason>` diagnostic
 * event plus the fact that no state moved. Asserting only "it failed" would pass
 * for a contract trap, an absent trustline, or a fee error, which is exactly the
 * confusion this suite exists to rule out.
 *
 * Requires `.env.phase2` (see `scripts/deploy-phase2-instance.ts`). Run with:
 *   npm run test:integration
