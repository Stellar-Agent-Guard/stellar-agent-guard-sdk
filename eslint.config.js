/**
 * ESLint flat config.
 *
 * Deliberately the non-type-checked `recommended` set: `tsc --noEmit` is already
 * the type gate in CI and runs as its own step, so duplicating it inside the
 * linter would only make the lint step slower and its failures harder to read.
 * What lint adds here is the class of problem the compiler does not report —
 * unused bindings, accidental `any`, shadowed names, `==` vs `===`.
