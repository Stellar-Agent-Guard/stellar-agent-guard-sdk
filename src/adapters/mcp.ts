/**
 * MCP adapter — guard a Model Context Protocol tool call at the boundary.
 *
 * Model Context Protocol tool calls (Claude Desktop and other MCP hosts) are
 * another surface where agent-driven contract actions originate. The spike for
 * this adapter (issue #45) checked the two published generations of the
 * TypeScript SDK and found a genuine **pre-execution** point in both:
 *
 * - v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`, spec `2026-07-28`) registers a tool with
 *   `server.registerTool(name, config, handler)`; the handler is `async (args,
 *   extra) => CallToolResult` and runs only after the host sends `tools/call`.
 * - v1 (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.x) exposes the same handler shape via
 *   `server.tool(name, schema, handler)` and, at the low level, via
 *   `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, handler)`.
 *
 * There is no "post-hoc only" problem to document here: returning a refusal
 * **without invoking the wrapped handler** means the tool body — the code that
 * signs and broadcasts a transaction — never runs. `guardMcpToolHandler` wraps
 * that handler. `guardMcpCallTool` covers the other side of the same boundary,
 * a client wrapping its own `callTool` before the request leaves the process.
 *
 * Written structurally, so neither `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` nor
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/server` becomes a dependency of this package. The
 * pinned revisions and the hook search are recorded in
 * `docs/integration-hooks.md` §4.
