/**
 * Typed preflight support for the contract's `validate_policy` read
 * (contracts issue #35; SDK issue #254).
 *
 * `set_policy` rejects an invalid configuration with the single stable
 * `invalid_config` error code, which is deliberately all the on-chain
 * rejection surface says. That is enough for a transaction, but useless for an
 * operator staring at a form: it names no field and no rule. The contracts repo
 * added a read-only `validate_policy(config) -> ValidationOutcome` entrypoint
 * (no auth, no writes, no events) that names the **first** failing SPEC §8 rule.
 * This module is the SDK's typed bridge to it:
 *
 *   - `buildValidatePolicyCall()` builds the read call from a candidate
 *     `PolicyConfig`, using the same canonical `policyToScVal` encoder as
 *     `set_policy` itself — there is one encoder, so a preflight cannot disagree
 *     with the transaction it is preflighting.
 *   - `validatePolicyOnChain()` simulates that call through the RPC and decodes
 *     the returned `ValidationOutcome`.
 *   - `decodeValidationOutcome()` decodes the externally tagged enum from either
 *     the host's `ScVal` or the JSON form a CLI prints, so an operator can pass
 *     a captured payload straight in.
 *   - `POLICY_RULE_MESSAGES` translates each of the eleven documented
 *     `PolicyRuleId` variants into the human-readable statement of the rule it
 *     enforces (SPEC §8.1).
 */

/** Wire shape
 *
 * `#[contracttype]` enums use the externally tagged representation: a unit
 * variant is a one-element vector of its name symbol, a tuple variant is the
 * variant name followed by its payload. Through `scValToNative` that is
 * `[\"Valid\"]` / `[\"Invalid\", \"AmountSign\"]`; the JSON a CLI prints is `\"Valid\"`
 * / `{ \"Invalid\": \"AmountSign\" }`. Both forms are accepted — `decode...` never
 * guesses, and a malformed payload is a typed `PolicyDecodeError`.
 */

/** Scope
 *
 * This is off-chain advisory validation. The contract re-validates on
 * `set_policy`, and its rejection code is unchanged; a preflight cannot turn an
 * invalid policy into a valid one.
