/**
 * Cost pre-checking: what will this call cost, asked *before* it is submitted.
 *
 * ## Why this is in-process and simulation-priced
 *
 * The choice was made deliberately and is recorded in the README: a call is
 * priced from the **real enforced simulation**, not from a local cost profiler.
 * `soroban-cost-estimator` profiles a locally compiled WASM artifact through the
 * `stellar` CLI, which this SDK does not have and does not need — it never
 * compiles a contract, it calls one that is already deployed. Making the SDK
 * depend on a CLI artifact it does not produce would be inventing a requirement.
 *
 * The number is not modelled or approximated. Every `enforceCall` already
 * returns it: `simulation.minResourceFee` is the network's own price for
 * executing *this* call with the guard's `__check_auth` run as part of it, since
 * the enforced simulation is the one that actually exercises the account's
 * authorization. A cost pre-check therefore costs one simulation and no
 * transaction, and the estimate is the same value the submission will declare.
 *
 * ## What this does not claim
 *
 * The estimate is a *resource* fee against the ledger snapshot the simulation
 * saw. It is not a promise about the final charged amount if the ledger moves
 * under the submission — `invoke.ts` documents that case and retries it once —
 * and it does not include any future surge pricing. It is reported as an
 * estimate, with the inclusion fee shown separately so the two are never
 * conflated.
 *
 * ## A block is not a cost overrun
 *
 * A guard refusal is reported as `blocked`, not as a cheap success, and carries
 * an explicitly zero fee because a refusal happens before broadcast: nothing was
 * submitted, so nothing was charged. Folding a refusal into an "over budget"
 * answer would tell a caller their call was too expensive when the truth is that
 * it was never allowed.

/**
 * Render a fee in stroops as an XLM decimal string, using **integer arithmetic
 * only**.
 *
 * ## Why there is no floating point here
 *
 * XLM has exactly 7 decimal places, so every stroop value is a rational number
 * with a denominator that is a power of ten — representable exactly as a decimal
 * string and *not* representable exactly as an IEEE-754 binary64. `0.1` stroops
 * is not a thing, but `stroops / 1e7` in `Number` lands on 0.1 for `1_000_000`
 * and drifts for others, and `Number` cannot even hold integers above 2^53.
 * This is a security tool that prints money-adjacent numbers: a formatter that
 * rounds silently is worse than one that refuses, so the division is done on
 * `bigint` and the digits are produced by string padding. Nothing here ever
 * passes through `Number`, `parseFloat`, `/`, or `toFixed`.
 *
 * ## Output convention: minimal, exact, no trailing garbage
 *
 * The result is the shortest decimal string that equals the input exactly —
 * trailing fractional zeros are dropped and a whole number prints with no
 * separator: `10_000_000` → `"1"`, `1_000_000` → `"0.1"` (not `"0.1000000"`),
 * `0` → `"0"`, `1` → `"0.0000001"`. The alternative, a fixed 7-dp pad, adds
 * zeros that imply precision the fee does not have; the minimal form is exact
 * in both directions, so `formatFee(parse(x)) === x` holds for every value this
 * function accepts.
 *
 * Input is `bigint` (exact, and the only way to express values above 2^53) or a
 * base-10 integer string. A `number` is rejected outright rather than coerced:
 * by the time it reaches this function any precision loss has already happened,
 * and accepting it would launder that loss into output that looks authoritative.
